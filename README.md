## Main Features
<ol>
<li>Shared task list</li>
	A task list provides a structured approach to managing your pets' daily routines, ensuring that important tasks such as feeding, exercise, and medication are not overlooked. It also allows users to plan their day around their pets’ requirements while ensuring they have proper care and treatment. A shared to-do list ensures everyone stays informed and contributes to the pets' routines seamlessly, especially when multiple caregivers are involved in pet care, such as animal shelters and pet cafes.
<li>Calendar</li>
	Integrating a calendar allows users to keep track of all important pet-related appointments, such as veterinary visits, grooming sessions, training classes, and more, in one convenient location. Users are able to set reminders and notifications for scheduled appointments, ensuring you receive timely alerts for important pet-related events. When adding a task, there is an option to mark it on the calendar to ensure only important events are shown on the calendar.
<li>Manage multiple pets within one organization</li>
	Users are able to create profiles for multiple pets in order to manage their daily routines at ease. This allows users to designate distinct daily routines, tasks, and schedules for each pet, accounting for differences in feeding times, exercise routines, medications, and other activities. Users are also able to track and record individual health information, such as medication records, recent check-up dates, and any medical conditions, for each pet separately.
